			<h1>Intro to HTML/CSS:<br>
			 Homework Assignment 3</h1>

			<p>For this week's homework, we are going to use advanced CSS to style our homework1.html. Save your homework2.css file as homework3.css and have at it!</p>

			<h2>Here are this week's homework activities:</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Create several divs of various widths, heights, and colors. Use margin to push them around the page.</li>
				<li>Make some of the &lt;div&gt;'s into links (anchors). Then, make the background color of the div change on mouse over.</li>
				<li>Try to position some of the &lt;div&gt;'s relative-ly in a vertical line down the middle of the page.</li>
				<li>Create a class that you can use with &lt;span&gt; tags to make whatever text that is selected twice the default size (Remember King Jong Un?).</li>
				<li>Extra credit: Use images as links and change them on mouseover.  This one is challenging BUT VERY FUN!  Ask the Google Machine.  Something like "Turn links into images CSS".</li>
			</ol>
